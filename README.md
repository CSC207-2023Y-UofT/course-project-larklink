# LarkLink
Running LarkLink is as simple as navigating to our `Main` class under `src/main/java` and running the `main` method. <br>
First you'll be prompted to either create an account or sign into an existing one, and then you'll be allowed to either Join or Host a chat room.
Once inside the room, you can send and receive normal messages or if you'd like to annoy your friends you can send a _lark_!
