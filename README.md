# LarkLink
## Introduction
LarkLink is a chat system that allows you to host a room or join existing rooms to chat with other users.
Once inside the room, you can send and receive normal messages or if you'd like to annoy your friends you can send a _lark_!
## Overview
### Main
Running LarkLink is as simple as navigating to our `Main` class under `src/main/java` and running the `main` method.
It allows you to initialize and start LarkLink.
### Signup and Login
If you don't have an account for LarkLink yet, you need to register first. To register, LarkLink requires you to enter
username and password.<br>

LarkLink allows alphanumeric characters for username and password. Username must be at least 3 characters long and
must not overlap with existing usernames. Password must be at least 8 characters long. 
If you try to set username and password shorter than each minimum length, you will see an error message.
If you enter valid username and password, you're all set! You'll be allowed to either Join or Host a chat room.
